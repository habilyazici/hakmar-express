# Hakmar Express v2

Ground-up rewrite of the Hakmar Express retail analytics dashboard, replacing
the legacy Express/Sequelize/MySQL app. See the audit report and Milestone 1
plan for the full rationale.

## Stack

- **API**: NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL
- **Web**: React + Vite + TanStack Query
- **Cache**: Redis (`@keyv/redis`)
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo

## Prerequisites

- Node 24, pnpm (`corepack enable`)
- Docker Desktop (for local Postgres + Redis)

## Getting started

```bash
docker compose up -d                          # postgres + redis
pnpm install
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
pnpm --filter api exec prisma migrate dev     # creates the schema
pnpm --filter api exec prisma db seed         # creates the first superadmin
pnpm dev                                      # api on :3000, web on :5173
```

Default seeded login: `superadmin` / `ChangeMe123!` (change immediately —
this is a dev-only default, see `apps/api/.env`).

`JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` must be at least 32 characters; the app validates its
whole environment at startup and refuses to boot otherwise, naming the
offending variable. Generate a real one with `openssl rand -hex 32`.

## Scripts (run from repo root, fan out via Turborepo)

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test        # unit tests
pnpm test:e2e    # e2e tests, needs postgres+redis running
pnpm build
```

## API

All routes are under `/api/v1` and require a bearer access token. RBAC is
fail-closed: a route carrying neither `@Roles()` nor `@Public()` is denied,
so a new endpoint cannot be left unguarded by omission.

| Area | Routes |
| --- | --- |
| Auth | `POST /auth/login`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/logout`, `GET /auth/profile` |
| Dashboard | `GET /dashboard/summary`, `/general-stats`, `/performance/:period`, `/daily-summary`, `/monthly-sales` |
| Charts | `GET /charts/trend`, `/ranking`, `/heatmap`, `/basket-size`, `/profit-waterfall`, `/customer-loyalty`, `/geographic-sales` |
| Tables | `GET /tables/ranking`, `/price-cost-history`, `/region-cost` |
| KDS | `GET /kds/abc-analysis`, `/demand-forecast`, `/customer-segmentation`, `/market-basket` |

The Charts and Tables routes replace ~51 near-identical legacy endpoints with
parameterized ones. Every parameter that reaches SQL is validated against an
enum first and then used only as a key into a lookup table of pre-written
`Prisma.Sql` fragments — user input never becomes SQL text.

## Status

Shipped: the cross-cutting NestJS architecture (guards/interceptors/filters,
validated environment, Redis cache), Prisma schema + migrations, auth with
rotating refresh tokens and reuse detection, and the Dashboard, Charts,
Tables and KDS Analytics modules with unit and e2e coverage on CI.

Web currently exposes the Dashboard Overview page; the Charts/Tables/KDS
endpoints are API-only so far.

Not yet started: Spatial Forecast (the OLS regression engine and GeoJSON
map), catalog/geo/customer master-data management, and transaction listing.

Decisions carried from the audit: Postgres over MySQL, Redis over the legacy
ad-hoc cache, Prisma over Sequelize, the raw-SQL admin tool dropped in favor
of Prisma Studio, the orphaned Subcategory relation completed, and the
unimplementable stock-based pricing rule dropped.
